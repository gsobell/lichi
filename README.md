**michi-c** is such a rewrite of Michi, in plain C.  It seems to play even with
GNUGo when given 3.3s/move: https://github.com/db3108/michi-c2.

Note: there is a clone version of the michi python code (slower than michi-c2) 
that is available at https://github.com/db3108/michi-c. 
This simpler version can be read in parallel with the michi.py python code.

**michi-go** is a rewrite of Michi in the Go language:
